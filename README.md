## 2D Strategy Game – Unity Project  

## 📌 Overview  
This repository contains the Unity project for a 2D strategy video game developed as part of a **video game development class** during my second year of engineering studies at École polytechnique. The game was co-developed with my colleague Ahmed H. and focuses on strategic gameplay mechanics in a 2D environment.  

## 🎮 Game Description
